	<b><big><big>6 Help System</big></big></b><br>
	<br>
	This section explains the concepts of the highly configurable Open Perl IDE 
	help system.<br>
	<br>
	<b><big>6.1 Help Configuration</big></b><br>
	<br>
	The complete help data consists of several main help topics.
	Each main help topic has a descriptive title, is associated with a base directory and  
	<ul>
	<li>its &quot;contents relevant data&quot; is defined as set of all files and directories located 
	under the base directory, and</li>
	<li>its &quot;keyword index relevant data&quot; is defined as set of all *.htm and *.html files 
	located under the base directory.</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	These main help topics can be configured on the &quot;Preferences | Help&quot; page as follows:
	<ul>
	<li>A new help topic can be added by choosing &quot;Add Help Location&quot; from 
	the listview popup menu and then selecting a base directory for the new help topic.</li>
	<li>A selected help topic can be deleted by choosing 
	&quot;Delete help location&quot; from the listview popup menu.</li>
	<li>The priority of each topic can be changed by dragging it to a new position.</li> 
	<li>Each line consists of several fields, each of these can be changed by a double click on it.
		<ul> 
		<li>The &quot;Base Directory&quot; field defines the location of the help files.</li>  
		<li>The &quot;Contents&quot; field controls, if the &quot;contents relevant data&quot;
			is used.</li> 
		<li>The &quot;Keyword Index&quot; field controls, if the &quot;keyword index relevant data&quot; 
			is used. </li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul>
	For example, in the screenshot below, the complete Contents contains only the 
	&quot;Open Perl IDE Documentation&quot;, and the Keyword Index is built 
	only from the &quot;ActivePerl Documentation&quot; Topic.<br>

	<b><big>6.2 Help Viewer</big></b><br>
	<br>
	You can open the help viewer by choosing Contents or Index from the Help 
	Menu or by pressing F1 from within an editor window. The help viewer is a 
	dockable window, however, the following screenshots show the help viewer in 
	floating state as a stand alone window.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Figure 6-2: Help Viewer Contents page<br></b>
	<img src="helpviewer_contents.gif" alt="HelpViewer Contents" width=590 height=304 border=0><br>
	<br>
	In the contents tree, Shell Links are automatically resolved to the source 
	document. So it is possible to create an independent contents organization 
	containing shortcuts to the original files.<br>
	<br>
	The next screenshot shows a typical help viewer, if the Perl command &quot;print&quot; has 
	been typed into an editor window and then F1 has been pressed.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Figure 6-3: Help Viewer Index page<br></b>
	<img src="helpviewer_index.gif" alt="HelpViewer Index" width=592 height=306 border=0><br>
	<br>
	If the help viewer has been opened from an editor window with F1, then 
	the ESC - Key switches the focus back to the editor window.<br>
	<br>
	The keyword index is automatically rebuilt, if the help configuration has 
	been changed:<br>
	<br>

	<br>
	<b><big>6.3 Help System Internals</big></b><br>
	<br>
	The keyword index generation consists of several steps:<br>
	<br>
	For each main topic
	<ul>
	<li>the base directory and its sub-directories are scanned and all 
	*.htm and *.html files are written to a list which is saved to a file.</li><br>
	<br>
	<li>Then the keyword generation script MakeIDX.pl takes this file, 
	parses each file in the list, extracts the keywords and writes it to an 
	index file. </li>
	</ul>
	Finally, after creating index files for all relevant topics, an offset file 
	is created to perform a fast access to all index files.<br>
